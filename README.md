# AmoebotSim-3D

Welcome to AmoebotSim-3D, a visual simulator for the [3D amoebot model](link-todo) developed by the [Self-Organizing Particle Systems (SOPS) Lab](https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University and the University of Paderborn. The amoebot model is an abstraction of _programmable matter_, a material that can dynamically change its physical properties (e.g., shape, size, color, etc.) based on user input or stimuli from its environment. This simulator is designed for researchers who want to:

- Visualize and learn about current distributed algorithms for the amoebot model
- Experiment with new ideas for amoebot model algorithms
- Perform validation and runtime testing for new or existing amoebot model algorithms

This README (and the simulator itself) are currently pre-alpha, work in progress.
